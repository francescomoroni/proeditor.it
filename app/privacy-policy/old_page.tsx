<p>The processing of your personal data is mainly necessary to

        the processing we perform on your data or ask for the confirmation that

    <li><b>Right of rectification</b>: you have the right to
        request for the rectification of your personal data if they are incorrect,

        the erasure of the data (or of part of it) you have provided us, including

        receive from Proeditors, in a structured, commonly used and
        machine-readable format, the personal data that you have provided us, in

        providing the Services.</li>

            Authority</b>: without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial

    we wish to provide you with more information about the use of cookies and other
    tracking tools (such as web beacons) through the Platform (&quot;<b>Platform</b>&quot;).
    Proeditors (<b>Proeditors</b>) uses these technologies primarily to make your
    experience on the Platform simpler and more intuitive and to provide you with
    more pleasant and efficient web-surfing.</p>

<p>Proeditors, at its own discretion and at any time, may
    modify, add or remove parts of the Cookie Policy. Therefore, we invite you to
    periodically check this Cookie Policy.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or comments about this Cookie
    Policy, please contact us by email at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@proeditor.it">info@proeditors.com</a>.</p>

<p><b>Cookies and similar technologies</b></p>

<p>Cookies are small text files sent by the Platform to your
    device (&quot;<b>Device</b>&quot;) and stored on the latter, to be
    retransmitted on each subsequent visit. Proeditors also uses other technologies
    (such as, for example, web beacons) that, like cookies, may store small amounts
    of data on your Device.</p>

<p><b>Technical cookies</b></p>

<p>Technical&nbsp;<i>cookies</i>&nbsp;are used for the sole
    purpose of optimizing your web-surfing on the Platform and to allow Proeditors
    to provide the required Services. Technical&nbsp;<i>cookies</i>&nbsp;used on
    the Platform can be further divided into:</p>

<ul type=disc>
    <li><b>Strictly necessary cookies</b></li>
</ul>

<p>These&nbsp;<i>cookies</i>&nbsp;are strictly necessary to
    allow your browsing on the Platform and for its proper functioning. They do not
    store personal information and are set only in response to your actions (such
    as, for example, a request for services, setting&nbsp;<i>privacy</i>&nbsp;preferences,
    logging in or filling out forms).</p>

<p>Navigation&nbsp;<i>cookies</i>&nbsp;are normally
    session&nbsp;<i>cookies</i>&nbsp;and, therefore, once the&nbsp;<i>browser</i>&nbsp;is
    closed, they are deleted. You can also set your&nbsp;<i>browser</i>&nbsp;to
    block or warn you about these&nbsp;<i>cookies</i>, but as a result some parts
    of the Platform may not work or work incorrectly.</p>

<ul type=disc>
    <li><b>Performance or analytical cookies</b></li>
</ul>

<p>These&nbsp;<i>cookies</i>&nbsp;allow us to gather
    statistical information, in an anonymous and aggregate form, about how many
    users access the Platform and how they use and engage with it. This allows us
    to improve the Platform performance and services.</p>

<ul type=disc>
    <li><b>Functionality cookies</b></li>
</ul>

<p>These cookies allow us to provide you with enhanced
    functionality and customization. In particular, they are used to store some of
    your preferences and information (for example language, country of origin,
    products selected for purchase) without you having to re-enter them on
    subsequent visits. Functionality cookies are often persistent cookies: they
    remain stored on your Device even after you close your browser, until their
    expiration date or until the user decides to delete them. If you do not authorize
    these cookies, some or all of the services may not function properly.</p>

<ul type=disc>
    <li><b>Profiling cookies</b></li>
</ul>

<p>Profiling cookies are designed to create profiles of the
    user and are used to send you advertisements in line with your browsing
    preferences.</p>

<p>These cookies may be set through our Platform by our
    advertising partners. They may be used by these companies to build a profile of
    your interests and to show you relevant ads on other web platforms.</p>

<p>The use of profiling cookies and other tracking tools
    requires the prior acquisition of your free consent. If you do not consent to
    the use of these cookies, you will not be shown or sent personalized ads, nor
    will profiles be created based on your interests. On the other hand, refusal or
    withdrawal of consent will not affect your ability to access or navigate the
    Platform.</p>

<ul type=disc>
    <li><b>How can you manage cookies?</b></li>
</ul>

<p>You may deny your consent and/or change your options
    regarding the Platform's use of cookies at any time via the &quot;Cookie
    Preferences&quot;. Please note, however, that disabling certain types of
    cookies may affect your navigation on the Platform and the use of its Services.</p>

<p>You can remove existing cookies and block the installation
    of new cookies through your browser settings. With particular reference to
    third-party cookies, please note that, if you have already given consent, you
    must delete them through the browser or by requesting the opt-out directly to
    the third parties or through the Platform.</p>
